Numpad Hotkeys
Each number is a hotkey for a weapon or usable item.
There are multiple hotkey menus; press 
When an item is cooling down, the hotkey displays an Arc2D pie that wipes clockwise starting from the top. It should take exactly one second for a full pie to disappear. If the cooldown is longer than one second, display additional pies underneath the current pie.
