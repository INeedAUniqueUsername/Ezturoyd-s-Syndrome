An endless-survival space shooter game with a few experimental mechanics. Fly a laser-shooting, plasma-spewing, titanium death machine and fight off waves of mysterious, silent, hostile starships as you struggle to survive in a magically inescapable death zone. Dodge enemy fire and try not to get blown to pieces in a high-speed collision. One of my first major video game projects.

To play the game, download and run SNES.jar
